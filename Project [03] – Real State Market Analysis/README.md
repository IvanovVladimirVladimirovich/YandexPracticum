## Real State Market Analysis

### Task: 
Using the data of the Yandex.Real estate service, determine the market value of real estate objects and typical parameters of apartments

### Description:
An analysis and preprocessing of a dataset containing advertisements for apartment sales in St. Petersburg was conducted. The study explored how factors such as area, ceiling height, number of rooms, and announcement date affect apartment prices across various neighborhoods and the city center. This analysis aims to support the development of an automated pricing system to prevent fraud and anomalies. Utilizing data from the Yandex.Real Estate service, the market value of different types of properties and typical apartment parameters, based on their distance from the city center, were determined. Data preprocessing was completed, including the addition of new data. Various visualizations, such as histograms, boxplots, and scatter diagrams, were created to represent the findings.
