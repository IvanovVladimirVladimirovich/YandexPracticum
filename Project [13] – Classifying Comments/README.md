## Classifying Comments

### Task: 
Speed up the moderation of comments in the community by automating their toxicity assessment. Train the model to classify comments as positive and negative.

### Description:
To launch a new service, an online store requires a tool to detect toxic comments and flag them for moderation. Users can edit and add product descriptions, similar to community wikis, where they can suggest edits and comment on changes made by others. A model was trained to classify comments as either positive or negative. The dataset, labeled for toxicity, was analyzed, and a model with an F1-score of at least 0.75 was developed. Feature engineering was applied to both text data and time series, with text vectorization performed using methods such as word2vec, GloVe, and FastText.
