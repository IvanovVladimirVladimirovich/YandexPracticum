## Research on the Reliability of Borrowers

### Task: 
Based on statistics on the solvency of clients, investigate whether the marital status and the number of the client's children affect the fact of the loan repayment on time.

### Description:
The input data from the bank's credit department, which includes statistics on client solvency, was processed to ensure accuracy. This involved removing outliers, handling omissions and duplicates, and converting various data formats. Data types were adjusted to match the stored information, and duplicates were eliminated. Textual data was normalized by highlighting lemmas and categorizing values. The proportion of creditworthy clients was calculated, and the impact of marital status and number of children on timely loan repayment was analyzed. A credit scoring model was developed to evaluate a potential borrower's ability to repay a loan.
