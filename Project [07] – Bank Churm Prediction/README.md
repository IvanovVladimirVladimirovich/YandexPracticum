## Bank Churm Prediction

### Task: 
Analysis of the outflow of clients from the bank to select a strategy (retaining old clients or attracting new clients)

### Description:
The bank began experiencing customer attrition on a monthly basis. To address this, a model was developed to predict the likelihood of a client leaving the bank in the near future. The model achieved a high F1-score, which was subsequently validated on a test set, reaching a value of 0.62. The AUC-ROC metric was also measured and found to be correlated with the F1-score. The model was built using supervised learning techniques, with special attention given to handling imbalanced data.
