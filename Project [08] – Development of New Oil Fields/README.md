## Development of New Oil Fields

### Task: 
Decide in which region to extract oil. Build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where mining will bring the most profit with the least risk of loss.

### Description:
The production company GlavRosGosNeft is tasked with determining the best location for drilling a new well. Data on oil samples from wells, including oil quality and reserve volume, has been collected across three regions. The characteristics of each well in these regions are already known. A predictive model was developed to estimate the reserve volumes in new wells, and wells with the highest projected values were selected. The regions with the highest potential total profit from these selected wells were identified. A separate model was built to determine which region would yield the greatest profit from production. Potential profits and associated risks were analyzed using the Bootstrap method.
