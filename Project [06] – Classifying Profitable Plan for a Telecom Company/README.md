## Classifying Profitable Plan for a Telecom Company

### Task: 
Build Machine Learning model for the classification problem, which finds a suitable tariff

### Description:
The mobile operator discovered that many customers are still using outdated tariff plans. A preliminary analysis of tariff usage was conducted on a sample of customers, focusing on their behavior when using the operator's services. Based on this, optimal service bundles were recommended for users. Hypotheses were tested regarding revenue differences between customers on various tariffs, as well as between subscribers in Moscow and other regions. A profitable tariff plan was identified to help optimize the advertising budget. Additionally, a system was developed to analyze customer behavior and suggest new tariff options. A classification model was built to accurately select the most suitable tariff, achieving a correct prediction rate of 75%. The model's accuracy was validated on a test dataset.
