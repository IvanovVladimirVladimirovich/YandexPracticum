## Determination of a Profitable Plan for a Telecom Company

### Task: 
Based on the data of the mobile operator's customers, analyze customer behavior and find the optimal tariff.

### Description:
The mobile operator discovered that many customers are using outdated tariffs. A preliminary analysis of tariff usage among a sample of customers was conducted, examining their behavior and recommending optimal service packages. Hypotheses were tested regarding revenue differences between subscribers of various tariffs and between subscribers from Moscow versus other regions. A profitable tariff plan was identified for adjusting the advertising budget. A system was developed to analyze customer behavior and suggest new tariffs. A classification model was created to recommend appropriate tariffs, achieving a high level of accuracy with a correctness rate of 0.75, which was verified using a test sample.
