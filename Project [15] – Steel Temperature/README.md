## Steel Temperature

### Task: 
In order to optimize production costs, the steelworks of So Hardening Steel Ltd. decided to reduce the electricity consumption during the steel processing phase. You will have to build a model that predicts the temperature of the steel.

### Description:
Steel is processed in a metal ladle with a capacity of approximately 100 tons. To withstand the extreme heat, the ladle's interior is lined with refractory bricks. Molten steel is poured into the ladle and heated to the required temperature using graphite electrodes installed in the lid. During the process, sulfur is removed from the alloy (desulfurization), its chemical composition is adjusted by adding specific impurities, and samples are taken. 
The steel is alloyed by altering its composition, either by feeding alloy pieces from a bulk material bin or by introducing alloying materials through a wire feed. Before the first alloying additives are introduced, the steel's temperature is measured, and a chemical analysis is performed. The temperature is then raised for several minutes, alloying materials are added, and the alloy is purged with inert gas. After mixing, the temperature and composition are checked again. This cycle is repeated until the desired chemical composition and optimal melting temperature are achieved.
