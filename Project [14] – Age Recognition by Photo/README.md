## Age Recognition by Photo

### Task: 
Build a machine learning model that determines the approximate age of a person from a photo. There is a set of photos of people with an indication of their age.

### Description:
A supermarket is introducing a computer vision system to analyze customer photos. Capturing images in the checkout area will help estimate customers' ages to:  
- Analyze purchasing patterns and recommend products relevant to their age group;  
- Ensure compliance with cashier protocols when selling alcohol.
 
A model was developed to estimate a person's approximate age from a photo. A dataset of photos labeled with ages was analyzed using computer vision techniques, leveraging pre-trained neural networks and the Keras library.
