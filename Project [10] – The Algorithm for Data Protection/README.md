## The Algorithm for Data Protection

### Task: 
The method of data transformation to protect the personal information of the clients of the insurance company.

### Description:
To safeguard the personal data of the insurance company's clients, data transformation methods were developed to make it difficult to recover sensitive information. Data preprocessing was performed, and the behavior of the linear regression algorithm when multiplied by an invertible matrix was tested. The impact of multiplying by an invertible matrix and then by its inverse was also examined. The RÂ² metric of the Linear Regression model was evaluated on both the original data and the data multiplied by an invertible matrix, with the matrix size matching the number of features. The metrics were identical, confirming that the algorithm functions as expected.
