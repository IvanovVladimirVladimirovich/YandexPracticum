## Patterns that Determine the Success of Game Platforms

### Task: 
Using historical data on sales of computer games, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms, identify patterns that determine the success of a game

### Description:
The online store sells computer games globally and has access to historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres, and platforms from open sources. This data was analyzed to identify the factors that influence a game's success in different regions. Potentially popular products were pinpointed and advertising campaigns were planned accordingly. The current period for analysis was selected, and user profiles for each region were created. Hypotheses were tested, including whether the average user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms are similar, and whether there is a difference in average ratings between the Action and Sports genres. Student's t-test for independent samples was employed for the analysis.
